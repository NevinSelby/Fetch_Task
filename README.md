# Fetch_Task

To run the website, you can either look up my deployed website "https://nevinfetchtask.streamlit.app/"

OR

You can perform the following steps:
1) Install Python (Preferably the latest version)
2) Clone this repo to your local directory by downloading the zip or using 'git clone https_of_this_repo'
   The https of this repo can be found here as shown in the below screenshot <br>

3) Extract the zip file, and store it in a desired directory.
4) Open your terminal, and navigate to the folder in which you have cloned this repository using the 'cd' command. I have added a screenshot of how my directory looks in the terminal.<br>

5) Create a virtualenv using 'python -m venv virtualenvname'<br>

6) Activate the virtual env by doing 'source myenv/bin/activate' for linux or 'myenv\Scripts\activate' for windows. I have windows, so I have done 'myenv\Scripts\activate'.<br>

7) Now, your directory in the terminal should look like the following screenshot:<br>

8) Then install all packages included in the requirements.txt file by doing 'pip install packagename'. Optionally you can install all packages in a single line by mentioning all packages together (You can view the following screenshot for clarity).<br>

9) Now, the next step is to run the app.
10) Then run 'streamlit run task.py'<br>

12) The website should now be autoloaded in the host given in terminal :)
